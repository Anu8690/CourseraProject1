Activity = Corresponds to the activity the subjects were meant to do. They were:
1 WALKING
2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4 SITTING
5 STANDING
6 LAYING

Subjects = Each entry identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample.
Its range is from 1 to 30.

## Rest all the variables are described in features_info.txt in UCI HAR Dataset directory.
